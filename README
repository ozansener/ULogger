This code is implemented by using only the pthread. It simply creates a log file (text file) and write log messages to this file asynchronously. Multi-threading enables this tool to run without slowing down the main functions of the software. It is also thred-safe.

To include this tool in your projcet, just include it and use it as shown in the main.cpp code. Also do not forget to link pthread to your solution.
